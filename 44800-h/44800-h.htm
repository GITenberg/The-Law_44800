    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone building a personal library of liberty must include in it a copy of
      Frédéric Bastiat's classic essay, "The Law." First published in 1850 by
      the great French economist and journalist, it is as clear a statement as
      has ever been made of the original American ideal of government, as
      proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence, that the main purpose of
      any government is the protection of the lives, liberties, and property of
      its citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bastiat believed that all human beings possessed the God-given, natural
      rights of "individuality, liberty, property." "This is man," he wrote.
      These "three gifts from God precede all human legislation." But even in
      his time&mdash;writing in the late 1840s&mdash;Bastiat was alarmed over
      how the law had been "perverted" into an instrument of what he called
      legal plunder. Far from protecting individual rights, the law was
      increasingly used to deprive one group of citizens of those rights for the
      benefit of another group, and especially for the benefit of the state
      itself. He condemned the legal plunder of protectionist <a name="linkvi"
      id="linkvi"></a> <span class="pagenum">vi</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      tariffs, government subsidies of all kinds, progressive taxation, public
      schools, government "jobs" programs, minimum wage laws, welfare, usury
      laws, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bastiat's warnings of the dire effects of legal plunder are as relevant
      today as they were the day he first issued them. The system of legal
      plunder (which many now celebrate as "democracy") will erase from
      everyone's conscience, he wrote, the distinction between justice and
      injustice. The plundered classes will eventually figure out how to enter
      the political game and plunder their fellow man. Legislation will never be
      guided by any principles of justice, but only by brute political force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great French champion of liberty also forecast the corruption of
      education by the state. Those who held "government-endowed teaching
      positions," he wrote, would rarely criticize legal plunder lest their
      government endowments be ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system of legal plunder would also greatly exaggerate the importance
      of politics in society. That would be a most unhealthy development as it
      would encourage even more citizens to seek to improve their own well-being
      not by producing goods and services for the marketplace but by plundering
      their fellow citizens through politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bastiat was also wise enough to anticipate what modern economists call
      "rent seeking" and "rent avoidance" behavior. These two clumsy phrases
      refer, respectively, to the phenomena of lobbying for political favors
      (legal plunder), and of engaging in political activity directed at
      protecting oneself from being the victim of plunder seekers. (For example,
      the steel manufacturing industry lobbies for high tariffs on steel,
      whereas steel-using industries, like the automobile industry, can be
      expected to lobby against high tariffs on steel). <a name="linkvii"
      id="linkvii"></a> <span class="pagenum">vii</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason why modem economists are concerned about "rent seeking" is the
      opportunity cost involved: the more time, effort and money that is spent
      by businesses on conniving to manipulate politics&mdash;merely
      transferring wealth&mdash;the less time is spent on producing goods and
      services, which increases wealth. Thus, legal plunder impoverishes the
      entire society despite the fact that a small (but politically influential)
      part of the society benefits from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable, in reading "The Law," how perfectly accurate Bastiat was
      in describing the statists of his day which, it turns out, were not much
      different from the statists of today or any other day. The French
      "socialists" of Bastiat's day espoused doctrines that perverted charity,
      education, and morals, for one thing. True charity does not begin with the
      robbery of taxation, he pointed out. Government schooling is inevitably an
      exercise in statist brainwashing, not genuine education; and it is hardly
      "moral" for a large gang (government) to (legally) rob one segment of the
      population, keep most of the loot, and share a little of it with various
      "needy" individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socialists want "to play God," Bastiat observed, anticipating all the
      future tyrants and despots of the world who would try to remake the world
      in their image, whether that image would be communism, fascism, the
      "glorious union," or "global democracy." Bastiat also observed that
      socialists wanted forced conformity; rigid regimentation of the population
      through pervasive regulation; forced equality of wealth; and dictatorship.
      As such, they were the mortal enemies of liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dictatorship" need not involve an actual dictator. All that was needed,
      said Bastiat, was "the laws," enacted <a name="linkviii" id="linkviii"></a>
      <span class="pagenum">viii</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      by a Congress or a Parliament, that would achieve the same effect: forced
      conformity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bastiat was also wise to point out that the world has far too many "great
      men," "fathers of their countries," etc., who in reality are usually
      nothing but petty tyrants with a sick and compulsive desire to rule over
      others. The defenders of the free society should have a healthy disrespect
      for all such men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bastiat admired America and pointed to the America of 1850 as being as
      close as any society in the world to his ideal of a government that
      protected individual rights to life, liberty, and property. There were two
      major exeptions, however: the twin evils of slavery and protectionist
      tariffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frédéric Bastiat died on Christmas Eve, 1850, and did not live to observe
      the convulsions that the America he admired so much would go through in
      the next fifteen years (and longer). It is unlikely that he would have
      considered the U.S. government's military invasion of the Southern states
      in 1861, the killing of some 300,000 citizens, and the bombing, burning,
      and plundering of the region's cities, towns, farms, and businesses as
      being consistent in any way with the protection of the lives, liberties
      and properties of those citizens as promised by the Declaration of
      Independence. Had he lived to see all of this, he most likely would have
      added "legal murder" to "legal plunder" as one of the two great sins of
      government. He would likely have viewed the post-war Republican Party,
      with its 50 percent average tariff rates, its massive corporate welfare
      schemes, and its 25-year campaign of genocide against the Plains Indians
      as first-rate plunderers and traitors to the American ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the latter pages of "The Law" Bastiat offers the sage advice that what
      was really needed was "a science of <a name="linkix" id="linkix"></a>
      <span class="pagenum">ix</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      economics" that would explain the harmony (or lack thereof) of a free
      society (as opposed to socialism). He made a major contribution to this
      end himself with the publication of his book, <i>Economic Harmonies</i>,
      which can be construed as a precursor to the modern literature of the
      Austrian School of economics. There is no substitute for a solid
      understanding of the market order (and of the realities of politics) when
      it comes to combating the kinds of destructive socialistic schemes that
      plagued Bastiat's day as well as ours. Anyone who reads this great essay
      along with other free-market classics, such as Henry Hazlitt's Economics
      in One Lesson and Murray Roth-bard's Power and Market, will possess enough
      intellectual ammunition to debunk the socialist fantasies of this or any
      other day.

      The law perverted! The law&mdash;and, in its wake, all the collective
      forces of the nation&mdash;the law, I say, not only diverted from its
      proper direction, but made to pursue one entirely contrary! The law become
      the tool of every kind of avarice, instead of being its check! The law
      guilty of that very iniquity which it was its mission to punish! Truly,
      this is a serious fact, if it exists, and one to which I feel bound to
      call the attention of my fellow citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hold from God the gift that, as far as we are concerned, contains all
      others, Life&mdash;physical, intellectual, and moral life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But life cannot support itself. He who has bestowed it, has entrusted us
      with the care of supporting it, of developing it, and of perfecting it. To
      that end, He has provided us with a collection of wonderful faculties; He
      has plunged us into the midst of a variety of elements. It is by <a
      name="link2" id="link2"></a> <span class="pagenum">2</span> the
      application of our faculties to these elements that the phenomena of
      assimilation and of appropriation, by which life pursues the circle that
      has been assigned to it are realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Existence, faculties, assimilation&mdash;in other words, personality,
      liberty, property&mdash;this is man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of these three things that it may be said, apart from all demagogic
      subtlety, that they are anterior and superior to all human legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not because men have made laws, that personality, liberty, and
      property exist. On the contrary, it is because personality, liberty, and
      property exist beforehand, that men make laws. What, then, is law? As I
      have said elsewhere, it is the collective organization of the individual
      right to lawful defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature, or rather God, has bestowed upon every one of us the right to
      defend his person, his liberty, and his property, since these are the
      three constituent or preserving elements of life; elements, each of which
      is rendered complete by the others, and that cannot be understood without
      them. For what are our faculties, but the extension of our personality?
      and what is property, but an extension of our faculties?
    </p>
    <p>
      If every man has the right of defending, even by force, his person, his
      liberty, and his property, a number of men have the right to combine
      together to extend, to organize a common force to provide regularly for
      this defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collective right, then, has its principle, its reason for existing, its
      lawfulness, in individual right; and the common force cannot rationally
      have any other end, or any other mission, than that of the isolated forces
      for which it is substituted. Thus, as the force of an individual cannot
      lawfully touch the person, the liberty, or the property of <a name="link3"
      id="link3"></a> <span class="pagenum">3</span> another individual&mdash;for
      the same reason, the common force cannot lawfully be used to destroy the
      person, the liberty, or the property of individuals or of classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this perversion of force would be, in one case as in the other, in
      contradiction to our premises. For who will dare to say that force has
      been given to us, not to defend our rights, but to annihilate the equal
      rights of our brethren? And if this be not true of every individual force,
      acting independently, how can it be true of the collective force, which is
      only the organized union of isolated forces?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing, therefore, can be more evident than this: The law is the
      organization of the natural right of lawful defense; it is the
      substitution of collective for individual forces, for the purpose of
      acting in the sphere in which they have a right to act, of doing what they
      have a right to do, to secure persons, liberties, and properties, and to
      maintain each in its right, so as to cause justice to reign over all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if a people established upon this basis were to exist, it seems to me
      that order would prevail among them in their acts as well as in their
      ideas. It seems to me that such a people would have the most simple, the
      most economical, the least oppressive, the least to be felt, the most
      restrained, the most just, and, consequently, the most stable Government
      that could be imagined, whatever its political form might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      For under such an administration, everyone would feel that he possessed
      all the fullness, as well as all the responsibility of his existence. So
      long as personal safety was ensured, so long as labor was free, and the
      fruits of labor secured against all unjust attacks, no one would have any
      difficulties to contend with in the State. When <a name="link4" id="link4"></a>
      <span class="pagenum">4</span> prosperous, we should not, it is true, have
      to thank the State for our success; but when unfortunate, we should no
      more think of taxing it with our disasters than our peasants think of
      attributing to it the arrival of hail or of frost. We should know it only
      by the inestimable blessing of Safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may further be affirmed, that, thanks to the nonintervention of the
      State in private affairs, our wants and their satisfactions would develop
      themselves in their natural order. We should not see poor families seeking
      for literary instruction before they were supplied with bread. We should
      not see towns peopled at the expense of rural districts, nor rural
      districts at the expense of towns. We should not see those great
      displacements of capital, of labor, and of population, that legislative
      measures occasion; displacements that render so uncertain and precarious
      the very sources of existence, and thus enlarge to such an extent the
      responsibility of Governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, law is by no means confined to its own sphere. Nor is it merely
      in some ambiguous and debatable views that it has left its proper sphere.
      It has done more than this. It has acted in direct opposition to its
      proper end; it has destroyed its own object; it has been employed in
      annihilating that justice which it ought to have established, in effacing
      amongst Rights, that limit which it was its true mission to respect; it
      has placed the collective force in the service of those who wish to
      traffic, without risk and without scruple, in the persons, the liberty,
      and the property of others; it has converted plunder into a right, that it
      may protect it, and lawful defense into a crime, that it may punish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      How has this perversion of law been accomplished? And what has resulted
      from it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link5" id="link5"></a> <span class="pagenum">5</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The law has been perverted through the influence of two very different
      causes&mdash;naked greed and misconceived philanthropy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us speak of the former. Self-preservation and development is the
      common aspiration of all men, in such a way that if every one enjoyed the
      free exercise of his faculties and the free disposition of their fruits,
      social progress would be incessant, uninterrupted, inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is also another disposition which is common to them. This is to
      live and to develop, when they can, at the expense of one another. This is
      no rash imputation, emanating from a gloomy, uncharitable spirit. History
      bears witness to the truth of it, by the incessant wars, the migrations of
      races, sectarian oppressions, the universality of slavery, the frauds in
      trade, and the monopolies with which its annals abound. This fatal
      disposition has its origin in the very constitution of man&mdash;in that
      primitive, and universal, and invincible sentiment that urges it towards
      its well-being, and makes it seek to escape pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man can only derive life and enjoyment from a perpetual search and
      appropriation; that is, from a perpetual application of his faculties to
      objects, or from labor. This is the origin of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      But also he may live and enjoy, by seizing and appropriating the
      productions of the faculties of his fellow men. This is the origin of
      plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, labor being in itself a pain, and man being naturally inclined to
      avoid pain, it follows, and history proves it, that wherever plunder is
      less burdensome than labor, it prevails; and neither religion nor morality
      can, in this case, prevent it from prevailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When does plunder cease, then? When it becomes more burdensome and more
      dangerous than labor. It is <a name="link6" id="link6"></a> <span
      class="pagenum">6</span> very evident that the proper aim of law is to
      oppose the fatal tendency to plunder with the powerful obstacle of
      collective force; that all its measures should be in favor of property,
      and against plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the law is made, generally, by one man, or by one class of men. And as
      law cannot exist without the sanction and the support of a preponderant
      force, it must finally place this force in the hands of those who
      legislate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This inevitable phenomenon, combined with the fatal tendency that, we have
      said, exists in the heart of man, explains the almost universal perversion
      of law. It is easy to conceive that, instead of being a check upon
      injustice, it becomes its most invincible instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to conceive that, according to the power of the legislator, it
      destroys for its own profit, and in different degrees amongst the rest of
      the community, personal independence by slavery, liberty by oppression,
      and property by plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in the nature of men to rise against the injustice of which they are
      the victims. When, therefore, plunder is organized by law, for the profit
      of those who perpetrate it, all the plundered classes tend, either by
      peaceful or revolutionary means, to enter in some way into the
      manufacturing of laws. These classes, according to the degree of
      enlightenment at which they have arrived, may propose to themselves two
      very different ends, when they thus attempt the attainment of their
      political rights; either they may wish to put an end to lawful plunder, or
      they may desire to take part in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Woe to the nation where this latter thought prevails amongst the masses,
      at the moment when they, in their turn, seize upon the legislative power!
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link7" id="link7"></a> <span class="pagenum">7</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to that time, lawful plunder has been exercised by the few upon the
      many, as is the case in countries where the right of legislating is
      confined to a few hands. But now it has become universal, and the
      equilibrium is sought in universal plunder. The injustice that society
      contains, instead of being rooted out of it, is generalized. As soon as
      the injured classes have recovered their political rights, their first
      thought is not to abolish plunder (this would suppose them to possess
      enlightenment, which they cannot have), but to organize against the other
      classes, and to their own detriment, a system of reprisals&mdash;as if it
      was necessary, before the reign of justice arrives, that all should
      undergo a cruel retribution&mdash;some for their iniquity and some for
      their ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be impossible, therefore, to introduce into society a greater
      change and a greater evil than this&mdash;the conversion of the law into
      an instrument of plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would be the consequences of such a perversion? It would require
      volumes to describe them all. We must content ourselves with pointing out
      the most striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, it would efface from everybody's conscience the
      distinction between justice and injustice. No society can exist unless the
      laws are respected to a certain degree, but the safest way to make them
      respected is to make them respectable. When law and morality are in
      contradiction to each other, the citizen finds himself in the cruel
      alternative of either losing his moral sense, or of losing his respect for
      the law&mdash;two evils of equal magnitude, between which it would be
      difficult to choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is so much in the nature of law to support justice that in the minds of
      the masses they are one and the same. There is in all of us a strong
      disposition to regard what is lawful as legitimate, so much so that many
      falsely derive <a name="link8" id="link8"></a> <span class="pagenum">8</span>
      all justice from law. It is sufficient, then, for the law to order and
      sanction plunder, that it may appear to many consciences just and sacred.
      Slavery, protection, and monopoly find defenders, not only in those who
      profit by them, but in those who suffer by them. If you suggest a doubt as
      to the morality of these institutions, it is said directly&mdash;"You are
      a dangerous experimenter, a utopian, a theorist, a despiser of the laws;
      you would shake the basis upon which society rests."
    </p>
    <p>
      If you lecture upon morality, or political economy, official bodies will
      be found to make this request to the Government:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     That henceforth science be taught not only with sole
     reference to free exchange (to liberty, property, and
     justice), as has been the case up to the present time, but
     also, and especially, with reference to the facts and
     legislation (contrary to liberty, property, and justice)
     that regulate French industry.

     That, in public lecterns salaried by the treasury, the
     professor abstain rigorously from endangering in the
     slightest degree the respect due to the laws now in
     force.<a href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2">2</a>
</pre>
    <p>
      So that if a law exists that sanctions slavery or monopoly, oppression or
      plunder, in any form whatever, it must not even be mentioned&mdash;for how
      can it be mentioned without damaging the respect that it inspires? Still
      further, morality and political economy must be taught in connection with
      this law&mdash;that is, under the supposition that it must be just, only
      because it is law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link9" id="link9"></a> <span class="pagenum">9</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another effect of this deplorable perversion of the law is that it gives
      to human passions and to political struggles, and, in general, to
      politics, properly so called, an exaggerated importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could prove this assertion in a thousand ways. But I shall confine
      myself, by way of an illustration, to bringing it to bear upon a subject
      which has of late occupied everybody's mind: universal suffrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever may be thought of it by the adepts of the school of Rousseau,
      which professes to be very far advanced, but which I consider 20 centuries
      behind, universal suffrage (taking the word in its strictest sense) is not
      one of those sacred dogmas with respect to which examination and doubt are
      crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serious objections may be made to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, the word universal conceals a gross sophism. There
      are, in France, 36,000,000 inhabitants. To make the right of suffrage
      universal, 36,000,000 electors should be reckoned. The most extended
      system reckons only 9,000,000. Three persons out of four, then, are
      excluded; and more than this, they are excluded by the fourth. Upon what
      principle is this exclusion founded? Upon the principle of incapacity.
      Universal suffrage, then, means: universal suffrage of those who are
      capable. In point of fact, who are the capable? Are age, sex, and judicial
      condemnations the only conditions to which incapacity is to be attached?
    </p>
    <p>
      On taking a nearer view of the subject, we may soon perceive the reason
      why the right of suffrage depends upon the presumption of incapacity; the
      most extended system differing from the most restricted in the conditions
      on which this incapacity depends, and which constitutes not a difference
      in principle, but in degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link10" id="link10"></a> <span class="pagenum">10</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This motive is, that the elector does not stipulate for himself, but for
      everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, as the republicans of the Greek and Roman tone pretend, the right of
      suffrage had fallen to the lot of every one at his birth, it would be an
      injustice to adults to prevent women and children from voting. Why are
      they prevented? Because they are presumed to be incapable. And why is
      incapacity a reason for exclusion? Because the elector does not reap alone
      the responsibility of his vote; because every vote engages and affects the
      community at large; because the community has a right to demand some
      assurances, as regards the acts upon which its well-being and its
      existence depend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know what might be said in answer to this. I know what might be
      objected. But this is not the place to settle a controversy of this kind.
      What I wish to observe is this, that this same controversy (in common with
      the greater part of political questions) that agitates, excites, and
      unsettles the nations, would lose almost all its importance if the law had
      always been what it ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, if law were confined to causing all persons, all liberties, and
      all properties to be respected&mdash;if it were merely the organization of
      individual right and individual defense&mdash;if it were the obstacle, the
      check, the chastisement opposed to all oppression, to all plunder&mdash;is
      it likely that we should dispute much, as citizens, on the subject of the
      greater or lesser universality of suffrage? Is it likely that it would
      compromise that greatest of advantages, the public peace? Is it likely
      that the excluded classes would not quietly wait for their turn? Is it
      likely that the enfranchised classes would be very jealous of their
      privilege? And is it not clear, that the interest of all being one and the
      same, some would act without much inconvenience to the others?
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link11" id="link11"></a> <span class="pagenum">11</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the fatal principle should come to be introduced, that, under
      pretense of organization, regulation, protection, or encouragement, the
      law may take from one party in order to give to another, help itself to
      the wealth acquired by all the classes that it may increase that of one
      class, whether that of the agriculturists, the manufacturers, the ship
      owners, or artists and comedians; then certainly, in this case, there is
      no class which may not try, and with reason, to place its hand upon the
      law, that would not demand with fury its right of election and
      eligibility, and that would overturn society rather than not obtain it.
      Even beggars and vagabonds will prove to you that they have an
      incontestable title to it. They will say:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     We never buy wine, tobacco, or salt, without paying the
     tax, and a part of this tax is given by law in perquisites
     and gratuities to men who are richer than we are. Others
     make use of the law to create an artificial rise in the
     price of bread, meat, iron, or cloth.

     Since everybody traffics in law for his own profit, we
     should like to do the same. We should like to make it
     produce the right to assistance, which is the poor man's
     plunder. To effect this, we ought to be electors and
     legislators, that we may organize, on a large scale, alms
     for our own class, as you have organized, on a large scale,
     protection for yours.
</pre>
    <p>
      Don't tell us that you will take our cause upon yourselves, and throw to
      us 600,000 francs to keep us quiet, like giving us a bone to pick. We have
      other claims, and, at any rate, we wish to stipulate for ourselves, as
      other classes have stipulated for themselves!
    </p>
    <p>
      How is this argument to be answered? Yes, as long as it is admitted that
      the law may be diverted from its true mission, that it may violate
      property instead of securing it, <a name="link12" id="link12"></a> <span
      class="pagenum">12</span> everybody will be wanting to manufacture law,
      either to defend himself against plunder, or to organize it for his own
      profit. The political question will always be prejudicial, predominant,
      and absorbing; in a word, there will be fighting around the door of the
      Legislative Palace. The struggle will be no less furious within it. To be
      convinced of this, it is hardly necessary to look at what passes in the
      Chambers in France and in England; it is enough to know how the question
      stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any need to prove that this odious perversion of law is a
      perpetual source of hatred and discord, that it even tends to social
      disorganization? Look at the United States. There is no country in the
      world where the law is kept more within its proper domain&mdash;which is,
      to secure to everyone his liberty and his property. Therefore, there is no
      country in the world where social order appears to rest upon a more solid
      basis. Nevertheless, even in the United States, there are two questions,
      and only two, that from the beginning have endangered political order. And
      what are these two questions? That of slavery and that of tariffs; that
      is, precisely the only two questions in which, contrary to the general
      spirit of this republic, law has taken the character of a plunderer.
      Slavery is a violation, sanctioned by law, of the rights of the person.
      Protection is a violation perpetrated by the law upon the rights of
      property; and certainly it is very remarkable that, in the midst of so
      many other debates, this double legal scourge, the sorrowful inheritance
      of the Old World, should be the only one which can, and perhaps will,
      cause the rupture of the Union. Indeed, a more astounding fact, in the
      heart of society, cannot be conceived than this: That law should have
      become an instrument of injustice. And if this fact occasions consequences
      so formidable to the United <a name="link13" id="link13"></a> <span
      class="pagenum">13</span> States, where there is but one exception, what
      must it be with us in Europe, where it is a principle&mdash;a system?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montalembert, adopting the thought of a famous proclamation of Mr.
      Carlier, said, "We must make war against socialism." And by socialism,
      according to the definition of Mr. Charles Dupin, he meant plunder. But
      what plunder did he mean? For there are two sorts: extralegal and legal
      plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to extralegal plunder, such as theft, or swindling, which is defined,
      foreseen, and punished by the penal code, I do not think it can be adorned
      by the name of socialism. It is not this that systematically threatens the
      foundations of society. Besides, the war against this kind of plunder has
      not waited for the signal of Mr. Montalembert or Mr. Carlier. It has gone
      on since the beginning of the world; France was carrying it on long before
      the revolution of February&mdash;long before the appearance of socialism&mdash;with
      all the ceremonies of magistracy, police, gendarmerie, prisons, dungeons,
      and scaffolds. It is the law itself that is conducting this war, and it is
      to be wished, in my opinion, that the law should always maintain this
      attitude with respect to plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is not the case. The law sometimes takes its own part. Sometimes
      it accomplishes it with its own hands, in order to save the parties
      benefited the shame, the danger, and the scruple. Sometimes it places all
      this ceremony of magistracy, police, gendarmerie, and prisons, at the
      service of the plunderer, and treats the plundered party, when he defends
      himself, as the criminal. In a word, there is a legal plunder, and it is,
      no doubt, this that is meant by Mr. Montalembert.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plunder may be only an exceptional blemish in the legislation of a
      people, and in this case, the best thing <a name="link14" id="link14"></a>
      <span class="pagenum">14</span> that can be done is, without so many
      speeches and lamentations, to do away with it as soon as possible,
      notwithstanding the clamors of interested parties. But how is it to be
      distinguished? Very easily. See whether the law takes from some persons
      that which belongs to them, to give to others what does not belong to
      them. See whether the law performs, for the profit of one citizen, and, to
      the injury of others, an act that this citizen cannot perform without
      committing a crime. Abolish this law without delay; it is not merely an
      iniquity&mdash;it is a fertile source of iniquities, for it invites
      reprisals; and if you do not take care, the exceptional case will extend,
      multiply, and become systematic. No doubt the party benefited will exclaim
      loudly; he will assert his acquired rights. He will say that the State is
      bound to protect and encourage his industry; he will plead that it is a
      good thing for the State to be enriched, that it may spend the more, and
      thus shower down salaries upon the poor workmen. Take care not to listen
      to this sophistry, for it is just by the systematizing of these arguments
      that legal plunder becomes systematized.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is what has taken place. The delusion of the day is to enrich all
      classes at the expense of each other; it is to generalize plunder under
      pretense of organizing it. Now, legal plunder may be exercised in an
      infinite multitude of ways. Hence come an infinite multitude of plans for
      organization; tariffs, protection, perquisites, gratuities,
      encouragements, progressive taxation, free public education, right to
      work, right to profit, right to wages, right to assistance, right to
      instruments of labor, gratuity of credit, etc., etc. And it is all these
      plans, taken as a whole, with what they have in common, legal plunder,
      that takes the name of socialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now socialism, thus defined, and forming a doctrinal body, what other war
      would you make against it than a <a name="link15" id="link15"></a> <span
      class="pagenum">15</span> war of doctrine? You find this doctrine false,
      absurd, abominable. Refute it. This will be all the easier, the more
      false, absurd, and abominable it is. Above all, if you wish to be strong,
      begin by rooting out of your legislation every particle of socialism which
      may have crept into it&mdash;and this will be no light work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montalembert has been reproached with wishing to turn brute force
      against socialism. He ought to be exonerated from this reproach, for he
      has plainly said: "The war that we must make against socialism must be one
      that is compatible with the law, honor, and justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      But how is it that Mr. Montalembert does not see that he is placing
      himself in a vicious circle? You would oppose law to socialism. But it is
      the law that socialism invokes. It aspires to legal, not extralegal
      plunder. It is of the law itself, like monopolists of all kinds, that it
      wants to make an instrument; and when once it has the law on its side, how
      will you be able to turn the law against it? How will you place it under
      the power of your tribunals, your gendarmes, and of your prisons? What
      will you do then? You wish to prevent it from taking any part in the
      making of laws. You would keep it outside the Legislative Palace. In this
      you will not succeed, I venture to prophesy, so long as legal plunder is
      the basis of the legislation within.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is absolutely necessary that this question of legal plunder should be
      determined, and there are only three solutions of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. When the few plunder the many.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. When everybody plunders everybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. When nobody plunders anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Partial plunder, universal plunder, absence of plunder, amongst these we
      have to make our choice. The law can only produce one of these results.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link16" id="link16"></a> <span class="pagenum">16</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Partial plunder. This is the system that prevailed so long as the elective
      privilege was partial; a system that is resorted to, to avoid the invasion
      of socialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Universal plunder. We have been threatened by this system when the
      elective privilege has become universal; the masses having conceived the
      idea of making law, on the principle of legislators who had preceded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absence of plunder. This is the principle of justice, peace, order,
      stability, conciliation, and of good sense, which I shall proclaim with
      all the force of my lungs (which is very inadequate, alas!) till the day
      of my death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in all sincerity, can anything more be required at the hands of the
      law? Can the law, whose necessary sanction is force, be reasonably
      employed upon anything beyond securing to every one his right? I defy
      anyone to remove it from this circle without perverting it, and
      consequently turning force against right. And as this is the most fatal,
      the most illogical social perversion that can possibly be imagined, it
      must be admitted that the true solution, so much sought after, of the
      social problem, is contained in these simple words&mdash;LAW IS ORGANIZED
      JUSTICE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it is important to remark, that to organize justice by law, that is to
      say by force, excludes the idea of organizing by law, or by force any
      manifestation whatever of human activity&mdash;labor, charity,
      agriculture, commerce, industry, instruction, the fine arts, or religion;
      for any one of these organizings would inevitably destroy the essential
      organization. How, in fact, can we imagine force encroaching upon the
      liberty of citizens without infringing upon justice, and so acting against
      its proper aim?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I am taking on the most popular prejudice of our time. It is not
      considered enough that law should be just, <a name="link17" id="link17"></a>
      <span class="pagenum">17</span> it must be philanthropic. It is not
      sufficient that it should guarantee to every citizen the free and
      inoffensive exercise of his faculties, applied to his physical,
      intellectual, and moral development; it is required to extend well-being,
      instruction, and morality, directly over the nation. This is the
      fascinating side of socialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, I repeat it, these two missions of the law contradict each other. We
      have to choose between them. A citizen cannot at the same time be free and
      not free. Mr. de Lamartine wrote to me one day thus: "Your doctrine is
      only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty, I go on to
      fraternity." I answered him: "The second part of your program will destroy
      the first." And in fact it is impossible for me to separate the word
      fraternity from the word voluntary. I cannot possibly conceive fraternity
      legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice
      legally trampled under foot. Legal plunder has two roots: one of them, as
      we have already seen, is in human greed; the other is in misconceived
      philanthropy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I proceed, I think I ought to explain myself upon the word plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not take it, as it often is taken, in a vague, undefined, relative,
      or metaphorical sense. I use it in its scientific acceptation, and as
      expressing the opposite idea to property. When a portion of wealth passes
      out of the hands of him who has acquired it, without his consent, and
      without compensation, to him who has not created it, whether by force or
      by artifice, I say that property is violated, that plunder is perpetrated.
      I say that this is exactly what the law ought to repress always and
      everywhere. If the law itself performs the action it ought to repress, I
      say that plunder is still perpetrated, and even, in a social point of
      view, under aggravated circumstances. In this case, <a name="link18"
      id="link18"></a> <span class="pagenum">18</span> however, he who profits
      from the plunder is not responsible for it; it is the law, the lawgiver,
      society itself, and this is where the political danger lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be regretted that there is something offensive in the word. I
      have sought in vain for another, for I would not wish at any time, and
      especially just now, to add an irritating word to our disagreements;
      therefore, whether I am believed or not, I declare that I do not mean to
      impugn the intentions nor the morality of anybody. I am attacking an idea
      that I believe to be false&mdash;a system that appears to me to be unjust;
      and this is so independent of intentions, that each of us profits by it
      without wishing it, and suffers from it without being aware of the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any person must write under the influence of party spirit or of fear, who
      would call into question the sincerity of protectionism, of socialism, and
      even of communism, which are one and the same plant, in three different
      periods of its growth. All that can be said is, that plunder is more
      visible by its partiality in protectionism, <a href="#linknote-3"
      name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a> and by its
      universality in communism; whence it follows that, of the three systems,
      socialism is still the most vague, the most undefined, and consequently
      the most sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, to conclude that legal plunder has one of its roots in
      misconceived philanthropy, is evidently to put intentions out of the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link19" id="link19"></a> <span class="pagenum">19</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this understanding, let us examine the value, the origin, and the
      tendency of this popular aspiration, which pretends to realize the general
      good by general plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Socialists say, since the law organizes justice, why should it not
      organize labor, instruction, and religion?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? Because it could not organize labor, instruction, and religion,
      without disorganizing justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For remember, that law is force, and that consequently the domain of the
      law cannot properly extend beyond the domain of force.
    </p>
    <p>
      When law and force keep a man within the bounds of justice, they impose
      nothing upon him but a mere negation. They only oblige him to abstain from
      doing harm. They violate neither his personality, his liberty, nor his
      property. They only guard the personality, the liberty, the property of
      others. They hold themselves on the defensive; they defend the equal right
      of all. They fulfill a mission whose harmlessness is evident, whose
      utility is palpable, and whose legitimacy is not to be disputed. This is
      so true that, as a friend of mine once remarked to me, to say that the aim
      of the law is to cause justice to reign, is to use an expression that is
      not rigorously exact. It ought to be said, the aim of the law is to
      prevent injustice from reigning. In fact, it is not justice that has an
      existence of its own, it is injustice. The one results from the absence of
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the law, through the medium of its necessary agent&mdash;force&mdash;imposes
      a form of labor, a method or a subject of instruction, a creed, or a
      worship, it is no longer negative; it acts positively upon men. It
      substitutes the will of the legislator for their own will, the initiative
      of the legislator for their own initiative. They have no need to consult,
      to compare, or to foresee; the law does all that for them. The intellect
      is for them a useless <a name="link20" id="link20"></a> <span
      class="pagenum">20</span> encumbrance; they cease to be men; they lose
      their personality, their liberty, their property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to imagine a form of labor imposed by force, that is not a violation
      of liberty; a transmission of wealth imposed by force, that is not a
      violation of property. If you cannot succeed in reconciling this, you are
      bound to conclude that the law cannot organize labor and industry without
      organizing injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, from the seclusion of his office, a politician takes a view of
      society, he is struck with the spectacle of inequality that presents
      itself. He mourns over the sufferings that are the lot of so many of our
      brethren, sufferings whose aspect is rendered yet more sorrowful by the
      contrast of luxury and wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ought, perhaps, to ask himself whether such a social state has not been
      caused by the plunder of ancient times, exercised in the way of conquests;
      and by plunder of more recent times, effected through the medium of the
      laws? He ought to ask himself whether, granting the aspiration of all men
      to well-being and improvement, the reign of justice would not suffice to
      realize the greatest activity of progress, and the greatest amount of
      equality compatible with that individual responsibility that God has
      awarded as a just retribution of virtue and vice?
    </p>
    <p>
      He never gives this a thought. His mind turns towards combinations,
      arrangements, legal or factitious organizations. He seeks the remedy in
      perpetuating and exaggerating what has produced the evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, justice apart, which we have seen is only a negation, is there any
      one of these legal arrangements that does not contain the principle of
      plunder?
    </p>
    <p>
      You say, "There are men who have no money," and you apply to the law. But
      the law is not a self-supplied <a name="link21" id="link21"></a> <span
      class="pagenum">21</span> fountain, whence every stream may obtain
      supplies independently of society. Nothing can enter the public treasury,
      in favor of one citizen or one class, but what other citizens and other
      classes have been forced to send to it. If everyone draws from it only the
      equivalent of what he has contributed to it, your law, it is true, is no
      plunderer, but it does nothing for men who want money&mdash;it does not
      promote equality. It can only be an instrument of equalization as far as
      it takes from one party to give to another, and then it is an instrument
      of plunder. Examine, in this light, the protection of tariffs, subsidies,
      right to profit, right to labor, right to assistance, free public
      education, progressive taxation, gratuitousness of credit, social
      workshops, and you will always find at the bottom legal plunder, organized
      injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say, "There are men who want knowledge," and you apply to the law. But
      the law is not a torch that sheds light that originates within itself. It
      extends over a society where there are men who have knowledge, and others
      who have not; citizens who want to learn, and others who are disposed to
      teach. It can only do one of two things: either allow a free operation to
      this kind of transaction, i.e., let this kind of want satisfy itself
      freely; or else preempt the will of the people in the matter, and take
      from some of them sufficient to pay professors commissioned to instruct
      others for free. But, in this second case there cannot fail to be a
      violation of liberty and property&mdash;legal plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say, "Here are men who are wanting in morality or religion," and you
      apply to the law; but law is force, and need I say how far it is a violent
      and absurd enterprise to introduce force in these matters?
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link22" id="link22"></a> <span class="pagenum">22</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the result of its systems and of its efforts, it would seem that
      socialism, notwithstanding all its self-complacency, can scarcely help
      perceiving the monster of legal plunder. But what does it do? It disguises
      it cleverly from others, and even from itself, under the seductive names
      of fraternity, solidarity, organization, association. And because we do
      not ask so much at the hands of the law, because we only ask it for
      justice, it alleges that we reject fraternity, solidarity, organization,
      and association; and they brand us with the name of individualists.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can assure them that what we repudiate is not natural organization, but
      forced organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not free association, but the forms of association that they would
      impose upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not spontaneous fraternity, but legal fraternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not providential solidarity, but artificial solidarity, which is
      only an unjust displacement of responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socialism, like the old policy from which it emanates, confounds
      Government and society. And so, every time we object to a thing being done
      by Government, it concludes that we object to its being done at all. We
      disapprove of education by the State&mdash;then we are against education
      altogether. We object to a State religion&mdash;then we would have no
      religion at all. We object to an equality which is brought about by the
      State then we are against equality, etc., etc. They might as well accuse
      us of wishing men not to eat, because we object to the cultivation of corn
      by the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      How is it that the strange idea of making the law produce what it does not
      contain&mdash;prosperity, in a positive sense, wealth, science, religion&mdash;should
      ever have gained ground in the political world? The modern politicians,
      particularly those of the Socialist school, found their different <a
      name="link23" id="link23"></a> <span class="pagenum">23</span> theories
      upon one common hypothesis; and surely a more strange, a more presumptuous
      notion, could never have entered a human brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They divide mankind into two parts. Men in general, except one, form the
      first; the politician himself forms the second, which is by far the most
      important.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, they begin by supposing that men are devoid of any principle of
      action, and of any means of discernment in themselves; that they have no
      initiative; that they are inert matter, passive particles, atoms without
      impulse; at best a vegetation indifferent to its own mode of existence,
      susceptible of assuming, from an exterior will and hand an infinite number
      of forms, more or less symmetrical, artistic, and perfected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, every one of these politicians does not hesitate to assume that
      he himself is, under the names of organizer, discoverer, legislator,
      institutor or founder, this will and hand, this universal initiative, this
      creative power, whose sublime mission it is to gather together these
      scattered materials, that is, men, into society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting from these data, as a gardener according to his caprice shapes
      his trees into pyramids, parasols, cubes, cones, vases, espaliers,
      distaffs, or fans; so the Socialist, following his chimera, shapes poor
      humanity into groups, series, circles, subcircles, honeycombs, or social
      workshops, with all kinds of variations. And as the gardener, to bring his
      trees into shape, needs hatchets, pruning hooks, saws, and shears, so the
      politician, to bring society into shape, needs the forces which he can
      only find in the laws; the law of tariffs, the law of taxation, the law of
      assistance, and the law of education.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is so true, that the Socialists look upon mankind as a subject for
      social experiments, that if, by chance, they <a name="link24" id="link24"></a>
      <span class="pagenum">24</span> are not quite certain of the success of
      these experiments, they will request a portion of mankind, as a subject to
      experiment upon. It is well known how popular the idea of trying all
      systems is, and one of their chiefs has been known seriously to demand of
      the Constituent Assembly a parish, with all its inhabitants, upon which to
      make his experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thus that an inventor will make a small machine before he makes one
      of the regular size. Thus the chemist sacrifices some substances, the
      agriculturist some seed and a corner of his field, to make trial of an
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But think of the difference between the gardener and his trees, between
      the inventor and his machine, between the chemist and his substances,
      between the agriculturist and his seed! The Socialist thinks, in all
      sincerity, that there is the same difference between himself and mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder the politicians of the nineteenth century look upon society as
      an artificial production of the legislator's genius. This idea, the result
      of a classical education, has taken possession of all the thinkers and
      great writers of our country.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all these persons, the relations between mankind and the legislator
      appear to be the same as those that exist between the clay and the potter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if they have consented to recognize in the heart of man a
      capability of action, and in his intellect a faculty of discernment, they
      have looked upon this gift of God as a fatal one, and thought that
      mankind, under these two impulses, tended fatally towards ruin. They have
      taken it for granted that if abandoned to their own inclinations, men
      would only occupy themselves with religion to arrive at atheism, with
      instruction to come to ignorance, and with labor and exchange to be
      extinguished in misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link25" id="link25"></a> <span class="pagenum">25</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, according to these writers, there are some men, termed governors
      and legislators, upon whom Heaven has bestowed opposite tendencies, not
      for their own sake only, but for the sake of the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst mankind tends to evil, they incline to good; whilst mankind is
      advancing towards darkness, they are aspiring to enlightenment; whilst
      mankind is drawn towards vice, they are attracted by virtue. And, this
      granted, they demand the assistance of force, by means of which they are
      to substitute their own tendencies for those of the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only needful to open, almost at random, a book on philosophy,
      politics, or history, to see how strongly this idea&mdash;the child of
      classical studies and the mother of socialism&mdash;is rooted in our
      country; that mankind is merely inert matter, receiving life,
      organization, morality, and wealth from power; or, rather, and still worse&mdash;that
      mankind itself tends towards degradation, and is only arrested in its
      tendency by the mysterious hand of the legislator. Classical
      conventionalism shows us everywhere, behind passive society, a hidden
      power, under the names of Law, or Legislator (or, by a mode of expression
      which refers to some person or persons of undisputed weight and authority,
      but not named), which moves, animates, enriches, and regenerates mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will give a quotation from Bossuet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     One of the things which was the most strongly impressed
     (by whom?) upon the mind of the Egyptians, was the love of
     their country.... Nobody was allowed to be useless to the
     State; the law assigned to every one his employment, which
     descended from father to son. No one was permitted to have
     two professions, nor to adopt another.
</pre>
    <p>
      ... But there was one occupation which was <a name="link26" id="link26"></a>
      <span class="pagenum">26</span> obliged to be common to all, this was the
      study of the laws and of wisdom; ignorance of religion and the political
      regulations of the country was excused in no condition of life. Moreover,
      every profession had a district assigned to it (by whom?).... Amongst good
      laws, one of the best things was, that everybody was taught to observe
      them (by whom?). Egypt abounded with wonderful inventions, and nothing was
      neglected which could render life comfortable and tranquil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus men, according to Bossuet, derive nothing from themselves;
      patriotism, wealth, inventions, husbandry, science&mdash;all come to them
      by the operation of the laws, or by kings. All they have to do is to be
      passive. It is on this ground that Bossuet takes exception when Diodorus
      accuses the Egyptians of rejecting wrestling and music. "How is that
      possible," says he, "since these arts were invented by Trismegistus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the same with the Persians:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     One of the first cares of the prince was to encourage
     agriculture.... As there were posts established for the
     regulation of the armies, so there were offices for the
     superintending of rural works....
</pre>
    <p>
      The respect with which the Persians were inspired for royal authority was
      excessive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greeks, although full of mind, were no less strangers to their own
      responsibilities; so much so, that of themselves, like dogs and horses,
      they would not have ventured upon the most simple games. In a classical
      sense, it is an undisputed thing that everything comes to the people from
      without.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link27" id="link27"></a> <span class="pagenum">27</span>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Greeks, naturally full of spirit and courage, had been
     early cultivated by kings and colonies who had come from
     Egypt. From them they had learned the exercises of the body,
     foot races, and horse and chariot races.... The best thing
     that the Egyptians had taught them was to become docile, and
     to allow themselves to be formed by the laws for the public
     good.
</pre>
    <p>
      FENELON&mdash;Reared in the study and admiration of antiquity and a
      witness of the power of Louis XIV, Fenelon naturally adopted the idea that
      mankind should be passive, and that its misfortunes and its prosperities,
      its virtues and its vices, are caused by the external influence that is
      exercised upon it by the law, or by the makers of the law. Thus, in his
      Utopia of Salentum, he brings the men, with their interests, their
      faculties, their desires, and their possessions, under the absolute
      direction of the legislator. Whatever the subject may be, they themselves
      have no voice in it&mdash;the prince judges for them. The nation is just a
      shapeless mass, of which the prince is the soul. In him resides the
      thought, the foresight, the principle of all organization, of all
      progress; on him, therefore, rests all the responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      In proof of this assertion, I might transcribe the whole of the tenth book
      of <i>Telemachus</i>. I refer the reader to it, and shall content myself
      with quoting some passages taken at random from this celebrated work, to
      which, in every other respect, I am the first to render justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the astonishing credulity that characterizes the classics, Fénelon,
      against the authority of reason and of facts, admits the general felicity
      of the Egyptians, and attributes it, not to their own wisdom, but to that
      of their kings:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link28" id="link28"></a> <span class="pagenum">28</span>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     We could not turn our eyes to the two shores, without
     perceiving rich towns and country seats, agreeably situated;
     fields that were covered every year,
     without intermission, with golden crops; meadows full of
     flocks; laborers bending under the weight of fruits that the
     earth lavished on its cultivators; and shepherds who made
     the echoes around repeat the soft sounds of their pipes and
     flutes. "Happy," said Mentor, "is that people who is
     governed by a wise king."... Mentor afterwards desired me to
     remark the happiness and abundance that was spread over all
     the country of Egypt, where twenty-two thousand cities might
     be counted. He admired the excellent police regulations of
     the cities; the justice administered in favor of the poor
     against the rich; the good education of the children, who
     were accustomed to obedience, labor, and the love of arts
     and letters; the exactness with which all the ceremonies of
     religion were performed; the disinterestedness, the desire
     of honor, the fidelity to men, and the fear of the gods,
     with which every father inspired his children. He could not
     sufficiently admire the prosperous state of the country.
     "Happy" said he, "is the people whom a wise king rules in
     such a manner."
</pre>
    <p>
      Fénelon's idyll on Crete is still more fascinating. Mentor is made to say:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     All that you will see in this wonderful island is the
     result of the laws of Minos. The education that the children
     receive renders the body healthy and robust. They are
     accustomed, from the first, to a frugal and laborious life;
     it is supposed that all the pleasures of sense enervate the
     body and the mind; no other pleasure is presented to them
     but that of being invincible by virtue, that of acquiring
     much glory... there they punish three vices that go
     unpunished amongst other people&mdash;ingratitude, dissimulation,
     and avarice. As to pomp and dissipation, there is no need to
     punish these, for they are unknown in Crete.... No costly
     furniture, no magnificent clothing, no delicious feasts, no
     gilded palaces are allowed.
</pre>
    <p>
      <a name="link29" id="link29"></a> <span class="pagenum">29</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thus that Mentor prepares his scholar to mould and manipulate,
      doubtless with the most philanthropic intentions, the people of Ithaca,
      and, to confirm him in these ideas, he gives him the example of Salentum.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we receive our first political notions. We are taught to treat men very
      much as Oliver de Serres teaches farmers to manage and to mix the soil.

    <h3>
      MONTESQUIEU&mdash;
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     To sustain the spirit of commerce, it is necessary that
     all the laws should favor it; that these same laws, by their
     regulations in dividing the fortunes in proportion as
     commerce enlarges them, should place every poor citizen in

     Although in a democracy, real equality be the soul of the

     is sufficient that a census be established to reduce or fix
     the differences to a certain point, after which, it is for
     particular laws to equalize, as it were, the inequality by
     burdens imposed upon the rich and reliefs granted to the
     poor.

     There were, in Greece, two kinds of republics. One was
     military, as Sparta; the other commercial, as Athens. In the
     one it was wished (by whom?) that the citizens should be
     idle: in the other, the love of labor was encouraged.

     It is worth our while to pay a little attention to the
     extent of genius required by these legislators, that
     we may see how, by confounding all the virtues, they showed
     their wisdom to the world. Lycurgus, blending theft with the
     spirit of justice, the hardest slavery with extreme liberty,
     the most atrocious sentiments with the greatest moderation,
     gave stability to his city. He seemed to deprive it of all
     its resources, arts, commerce, money, and walls; there was
     ambition without the hope of rising; there were natural
     sentiments where the individual was neither child, nor
     husband, nor father. Chastity even was deprived of modesty.
     By this road Sparta was led on to grandeur and to glory.

     The phenomenon that we observe in the institutions of
     Greece has been seen in the midst of the degeneracy and
     corruption of our modern times. An honest legislator has
     formed a people where probity has appeared as natural as
     bravery among the Spartans. Mr. Penn is a true Lycurgus, and
     although the former had peace for his object, and the latter
     war, they resemble each other in the singular path along
     which they have led their people, in their influence over
     free men, in the prejudices which they have overcome, the
     passions they have subdued.

     Paraguay furnishes us with another example. Society has
     been accused of the crime of regarding the pleasure of
     commanding as the only good of life; but it will always be a
     noble thing to govern men by making them happy.

     Those who desire to form similar institutions will
     establish community of property, as in the republic of
     Plato, the same reverence as he enjoined for the gods,
     separation from strangers for the preservation of morality,
     and make the city and not the citizens create commerce: they
     should give our arts without our luxury, our wants without
     our desires.

      ROUSSEAU&mdash;Although this politician, the paramount authority of the
      Democrats, makes the social edifice rest upon the general will, no one has
      so completely admitted the hypothesis of the entire passiveness of human
      nature in the presence of the lawgiver:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     If it is true that a great prince is a rare thing, how
     much more so must a great lawgiver be? The former has only
     to follow the pattern proposed to him by the latter. This
     latter is the engineer who invents the machine; the former
     is merely the workman who sets it in motion.

      And what part have men to act in all this? That of the machine, which is
      set in motion; or rather, are they not the brute matter of which the
      machine is made? Thus, between the legislator and the prince, between the
      prince and his subjects, there are the same relations as those that exist
      between the agricultural writer and the agriculturist, the agriculturist
      and the clod. At what a vast height, then, is the politician placed, who
      rules over legislators themselves and teaches them their trade in such
      imperative terms as the following:

     Would you give consistency to the State? Bring the
     extremes together as much as possible. Suffer neither
     wealthy persons nor beggars. If the soil is poor and barren,
     or the country too much confined for the inhabitants, turn
     to industry and the arts, whose productions you will
     exchange for the provisions which you require.... On a good
     soil, if you are short of inhabitants, give all your
     attention to agriculture, which multiplies men, and banish
     the arts, which only serve to depopulate the country.... Pay
     attention to extensive and convenient coasts. Cover the sea
     with vessels, and you will have a brilliant and short
     existence. If your seas wash only inaccessible rocks, let
     the people be barbarous, and eat fish; they will live more
     quietly, perhaps better, and most certainly more happily. In
     short, besides those maxims which are common to all, every
     people has its own particular circumstances, which demand a
     legislation peculiar to itself.

     It was thus that the Hebrews formerly, and the Arabs more
     recently, had religion for their principal object; that of
     the Athenians was literature; that of Carthage and Tyre,
     commerce; of Rhodes, naval affairs; of Sparta, war; and of
     Rome, virtue.
</pre>
    <p>
      The author of the "Spirit of Laws" has shown the art by which the
      legislator should frame his institutions towards each of these objects....
      But if the legislator, mistaking his object, should take up a principle
      different from that which arises from the nature of things; if one should
      tend to slavery, and the other to liberty; if one to wealth, and the other
      to population; one to peace, and the other to conquests; the laws will
      insensibly become enfeebled, the Constitution will be impaired, and the
      State will be subject to incessant agitations until it is destroyed, or
      becomes changed, and invincible Nature regains her empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Nature is sufficiently invincible to regain its empire, why does
      not Rousseau admit that it had no need of the legislator to gain its
      empire from the beginning?

      Why does he not allow that by obeying their own impulse, men would of

      extensive and commodious coasts without the interference of a Lycurgus, a
      Solon, or a Rousseau, who would undertake it at the risk of deceiving
      themselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, we see with what a terrible responsibility Rousseau
      invests inventors, institutors, conductors, and manipulators of societies.
      He is, therefore, very exacting with regard to them.

<pre xml:space="preserve">

     forms a part; he must feel that he can change the
     constitution of man, to fortify it, and substitute a social
     and moral existence for the physical and independent one
     that we have all received from nature. In a word, he must

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The climate, that is, the air and the soil, is the first
     element for the legislator. His resources prescribe to him
     his duties. First, he must consult his local position. A
     population dwelling upon maritime shores must have laws
     fitted for navigation.... If the colony is located in an
     inland region, a legislator must provide for the nature of
     the soil, and for its degree of fertility....
<a name="link34" id="link34"></a>
    <span class="pagenum">34</span>
     It is more especially in the distribution of property
     that the wisdom of legislation will appear. As a
     general rule, and in every country, when a new colony is
     founded, land should be given to each man, sufficient for
     the support of his family....

     In an uncultivated island, which you are colonizing with
     children, it will only be needful to let the germs of truth
     expand in the developments of reason!... But when you
     establish old people in a new country, the skill consists in
     only allowing it those injurious opinions and customs which
     it is impossible to cure and correct. If you wish to prevent
     them from being perpetuated, you will act upon the rising
     generation by a general and public education of the
     children. A prince or legislator ought never to found a
     colony without previously sending wise men there to instruct
     the youth.... In a new colony, every facility is open to the
     precautions of the legislator who desires to purify the tone
     and the manners of the people. If he has genius and virtue,
     the lands and the men that are at his disposal will inspire
     his soul with a plan of society that a writer can only
     vaguely trace, and in a way that would be subject to the
     instability of all hypotheses, which are varied and
     complicated by an infinity of circumstances too difficult to
     foresee and to combine.

      His resources dictate to him his duties. The first thing he has to

      set about it. Every facility is open to the agriculturist who wishes to
      clear and improve his soil.

      If he only has the skill, the manure which he has at his disposal will

     Take upon yourself, my lord, the character of Lycurgus or

     pleasures of the passions to become distasteful to them by
     punishments, and you will see these barbarians, with every
     plan of your legislation, lose a vice and gain a virtue.

     All these people have had laws. But few among them have
     been happy. Why is this? Because legislators have almost
     always been ignorant of the object of society, which is to
     unite families by a common interest.

     Impartiality in law consists in two things, in
     establishing equality in the fortunes and in the dignity of
     the citizens.... In proportion to the degree of equality
     established by the laws, the dearer will they become to
     every citizen. How can avarice, ambition, dissipation,
     idleness, sloth, envy, hatred, or jealousy agitate men who
     are equal in fortune and dignity, and to whom the laws leave
     no hope of disturbing their equality?

      It is not to be wondered at that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
      should have looked upon the human race as inert matter, ready to receive
      everything&mdash;form, figure, impulse, movement, and life, from a great
      prince, or a great legislator, or a great genius. These ages were reared
      in the study of antiquity; and antiquity presents everywhere&mdash;in
      Egypt, Persia, Greece, and Rome, the <a name="link37" id="link37"></a>
      <span class="pagenum">37</span> spectacle of a few men molding mankind
      according to their fancy, and mankind to this end enslaved by force or by
      imposture. And what does this prove? That because men and society are
      improvable, error, ignorance, despotism, slavery, and superstition must be
      more prevalent in early times. The mistake of the writers quoted above is
      not that they have asserted this fact, but that they have proposed it as a
      rule for the admiration and imitation of future generations. Their mistake
      has been, with an inconceivable absence of discernment, and upon the faith
      of a puerile conventionalism, that they have admitted what is
      inadmissible, viz., the grandeur, dignity, morality, and well-being of the
      artificial societies of the ancient world; they have not understood that
      time produces and spreads enlightenment; and that in proportion to the
      increase of enlightenment, right ceases to be upheld by force, and society
      regains possession of herself.

      And, in fact, what is the political work that we are endeavoring to
      promote? It is no other than the instinctive effort of every people
      towards liberty. And what is liberty, whose name can make every heart
      beat, and which can agitate the world, but the union of all liberties, the
      liberty of conscience, of education, of association, of the press, of
      movement, of labor, and of exchange; in other words, the free exercise,
      for all, of all the inoffensive faculties; and again, in other words, the
      destruction of all despotisms, even of legal despotism, and the reduction
      of law to its only rational sphere, which is to regulate the individual
      right of legitimate defense, or to repress injustice?
    </p>
    <p>
      This tendency of the human race, it must be admitted, is greatly thwarted,
      particularly in our country, by the fatal disposition, resulting from
      classical teaching and common to all politicians, of placing themselves
      beyond <a name="link38" id="link38"></a> <span class="pagenum">38</span>
      mankind, to arrange, organize, and regulate it, according to their fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For whilst society is struggling to realize liberty, the great men who
      place themselves at its head, imbued with the principles of the
      seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, think only of subjecting it to the
      philanthropic despotism of their social inventions, and making it bear
      with docility, according to the expression of Rousseau, the yoke of public
      felicity as pictured in their own imaginations.

    <p>
      This was particularly the case in 1789. No sooner was the old system

      Men, therefore, are nothing but raw material. It is not for them to will

      literally, the legislator is to begin by assigning the aim of the
      institutions of the nation. After this, the Government has only to direct
      all its physical and moral forces towards this end. All this time the
      nation itself is to remain perfectly passive; and Billaud Varennes would
      teach us that it ought to have no prejudices, affections, nor wants, but

      At what a vast height above the rest of mankind does Robespierre place
      himself here! And observe the arrogance with which he speaks. He is not
      content with expressing a desire for a great renovation of the human
      heart, he does not even expect such a result from a regular Government.
      No; he intends to effect it himself, and by means of terror. The object of
      the discourse from which this puerile and laborious mass of antithesis is
      extracted, was to exhibit the principles of morality that ought to direct
      a revolutionary Government. Moreover, when Robespierre asks for a
      dictatorship, it is not merely for the purpose of repelling a foreign
      enemy, or of putting down factions; it is that he may establish, by means
      of terror and as a preliminary to the operation of the Constitution, his
      own principles of morality. He pretends to nothing short of extirpating
      from the country by means of terror, self-interest, honor, customs,
      decorum, fashion, vanity, the love of money, good company, intrigue, wit,
      luxury, and misery. It is not until after he, Robespierre, shall have
      accomplished these miracles, as he rightly calls them, that he will allow
      the law to regain her empire. Truly it would be well if these visionaries,
      who think so much of themselves and so little of mankind, who want to <a

      everything, would only be content with trying to reform themselves, the

      gentlemen, the reformers, legislators, and politicians, do not desire to
      exercise an immediate despotism over mankind. No, they are too moderate
      and too philanthropic for that. They only contend for the despotism, the

      was to him the material for his experiments. But this material reacted
      against him. More than half undeceived, Bonaparte, at St. Helena, seemed
      to admit that there is an initiative in every people, and he became less
      hostile to liberty. Yet this did not prevent him from giving this lesson
      to his son in his will&mdash;"To govern is to diffuse morality, education,
      and well-being."
    </p>
    <p>
      After all this, I hardly need show, by fastidious quotations, the opinions
      of Morelly, Babeuf, Owen, Saint Simon, and Fourier. I shall confine myself
      to a few extracts from Louis Blanc's book on the organization of labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In our project, society receives the impulse of power."
    </p>
    <p>
      In what does the impulse that power gives to society consist? In imposing
      upon it the project of Mr. Louis Blanc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link42" id="link42"></a> <span class="pagenum">42</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, society is the human race. The human race, then, is to
      receive its impulse from Mr. Louis Blanc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is at liberty to do so or not, it will be said. Of course the human
      race is at liberty to take advice from anybody, whoever it may be. But
      this is not the way in which Mr. Louis Blanc understands the thing. He
      means that his project should be converted into law, and consequently
      forcibly imposed by power.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     In our project, the State has only to give a legislation
     to labor, by means of which the industrial movement may and
     ought to be accomplished in all liberty. It (the State)
     merely places society on an incline (that is all) that it
     may descend, when once it is placed there, by the mere force
     of things, and by the natural course of the established
     mechanism.
</pre>
    <p>
      But what is this incline? One indicated by Mr. Louis Blanc. Does it not
      lead to an abyss? No, it leads to happiness. Why, then, does not society
      go there of itself? Because it does not know what it wants, and it
      requires an impulse. What is to give it this impulse? Power. And who is to
      give the impulse to power? The inventor of the machine, Mr. Louis Blanc.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall never get out of this circle&mdash;mankind passive, and a great
      man moving it by the intervention of the law. Once on this incline, will
      society enjoy something like liberty? Without a doubt. And what is
      liberty?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Once for all: liberty consists not only in the right
     granted, but in the power given to man to exercise, to
     develop his faculties under the empire of justice, and under
     the protection of the law.
<a name="link43" id="link43"></a>
    <span class="pagenum">43</span>
     And this is no vain distinction; there is a deep meaning
     in it, and its consequences are imponderable. For
     when once it is admitted that man, to be truly free, must
     have the power to exercise and develop his faculties, it
     follows that every member of society has a claim upon it for
     such education as shall enable his faculties to display
     themselves, and for the tools of labor, without which human
     activity can find no scope. Now, by whose intervention is
     society to give to each of its members the requisite
     education and the necessary tools of labor, unless by that
     of the State?
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus, liberty is power. In what does this power consist? In possessing
      education and tools of labor. Who is to give education and tools of labor?
      Society, who owes them. By whose intervention is society to give tools of
      labor to those who do not possess them? By the intervention of the State.
      From whom is the State to obtain them?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is for the reader to answer this question, and to notice whither all
      this tends.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the strangest phenomena of our time, and one that will probably be
      a matter of astonishment to our descendants, is the doctrine which is
      founded upon this triple hypothesis: the radical passiveness of mankind,&mdash;the
      omnipotence of the law,&mdash;the infallibility of the legislator: this is
      the sacred symbol of the party that proclaims itself exclusively
      democratic.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that it professes also to be social.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as it is democratic, it has an unlimited faith in mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as it is social, it places mankind beneath the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are political rights under discussion? Is a legislator to be chosen? Oh,
      then the people possess science by instinct: they are gifted with an
      admirable discernment; their will is always right; the general will cannot
      err. Suffrage cannot <a name="link44" id="link44"></a> <span
      class="pagenum">44</span> be too universal. Nobody is under any
      responsibility to society. The will and the capacity to choose well are
      taken for granted. Can the people be mistaken? Are we not living in an age
      of enlightenment? What! Are the people to be forever led about by the
      nose? Have they not acquired their rights at the cost of effort and
      sacrifice? Have they not given sufficient proof of intelligence and
      wisdom? Are they not arrived at maturity? Are they not in a state to judge
      for themselves? Do they not know their own interest? Is there a man or a
      class who would dare to claim the right of putting himself in the place of
      the people, of deciding and of acting for them? No, no; the people would
      be free, and they shall be so. They wish to conduct their own affairs, and
      they shall do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when once the legislator is duly elected, then indeed the style of his
      speech alters. The nation is sent back into passiveness, inertness,
      nothingness, and the legislator takes possession of omnipotence. It is for
      him to invent, for him to direct, for him to impel, for him to organize.
      Mankind has nothing to do but to submit; the hour of despotism has struck.
      And we must observe that this is decisive; for the people, just before so
      enlightened, so moral, so perfect, have no inclinations at all, or, if
      they have any, these all lead them downwards towards degradation. And yet
      they ought to have a little liberty! But are we not assured by Mr.
      Considerant that liberty leads fatally to monopoly? Are we not told that
      liberty is competition? and that competition, according to Mr. Louis
      Blanc, is a system of extermination for the people, and of ruination for
      trade? For that reason people are exterminated and ruined in proportion as
      they are free&mdash;take, for example, Switzerland, Holland, England, and
      the United States? Does not Mr. Louis Blanc tell us again that competition
      <a name="link45" id="link45"></a> <span class="pagenum">45</span> leads to
      monopoly, and that, for the same reason, cheapness leads to exorbitant
      prices? That competition tends to drain the sources of consumption, and
      diverts production to a destructive activity? That competition forces
      production to increase, and consumption to decrease&mdash;whence it
      follows that free people produce for the sake of not consuming; that there
      is nothing but oppression and madness among them; and that it is
      absolutely necessary for Mr. Louis Blanc to see to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      What sort of liberty should be allowed to men? Liberty of conscience?&mdash;But
      we should see them all profiting by the permission to become atheists.
      Liberty of education?&mdash;But parents would be paying professors to
      teach their sons immorality and error; besides, if we are to believe Mr.
      Thiers, education, if left to the national liberty, would cease to be
      national, and we should be educating our children in the ideas of the
      Turks or Hindus, instead of which, thanks to the legal despotism of the
      universities, they have the good fortune to be educated in the noble ideas
      of the Romans. Liberty of labor? But this is only competition, whose
      effect is to leave all products unconsumed, to exterminate the people, and
      to ruin the tradesmen. The liberty of exchange? But it is well known that
      the protectionists have shown, over and over again, that a man will
      inevitably be ruined when he exchanges freely, and that to become rich it
      is necessary to exchange without liberty. Liberty of association? But
      according to the socialist doctrine, liberty and association exclude each
      other, for the liberty of men is attacked just to force them to associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must see, then, that the socialist democrats cannot in conscience
      allow men any liberty, because, by their own <a name="link46" id="link46"></a>
      <span class="pagenum">46</span> nature, they tend in every instance to all
      kinds of degradation and demoralization.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are therefore left to conjecture, in this case, upon what foundation
      universal suffrage is claimed for them with so much importunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pretensions of organizers suggest another question, which I have often
      asked them, and to which I am not aware that I ever received an answer:
      Since the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to
      allow them liberty, how comes it to pass that the tendencies of organizers
      are always good? Do not the legislators and their agents form a part of
      the human race? Do they consider that they are composed of different
      materials from the rest of mankind? They say that society, when left to
      itself, rushes to inevitable destruction, because its instincts are
      perverse. They presume to stop it in its downward course, and to give it a
      better direction. They have, therefore, received from heaven, intelligence
      and virtues that place them beyond and above mankind: let them show their
      title to this superiority. They would be our shepherds, and we are to be
      their flock. This arrangement presupposes in them a natural superiority,
      the right to which we are fully justified in calling upon them to prove.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must observe that I am not contending against their right to invent
      social combinations, to propagate them, to recommend them, and to try them
      upon themselves, at their own expense and risk; but I do dispute their
      right to impose them upon us through the medium of the law, that is, by
      force and by public taxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not insist upon the Cabetists, the Fourierists, the Proudhonians,
      the Academics, and the Protectionists renouncing their own particular
      ideas; I would only have them renounce the idea that is common to them all&mdash;viz.,
      <a name="link47" id="link47"></a> <span class="pagenum">47</span> that of
      subjecting us by force to their own categories and rankings to their
      social laboratories, to their ever-inflating bank, to their Greco-Roman
      morality, and to their commercial restrictions. I would ask them to allow
      us the faculty of judging of their plans, and not to oblige us to adopt
      them if we find that they hurt our interests or are repugnant to our
      consciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      To presume to have recourse to power and taxation, besides being
      oppressive and unjust, implies further, the pernicious assumption that the
      organized is infallible, and mankind incompetent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if mankind is not competent to judge for itself, why do they talk so
      much about universal suffrage?
    </p>
    <p>
      This contradiction in ideas is unhappily to be found also in facts; and
      whilst the French nation has preceded all others in obtaining its rights,
      or rather its political claims, this has by no means prevented it from
      being more governed, and directed, and imposed upon, and fettered, and
      cheated, than any other nation. It is also the one, of all others, where
      revolutions are constantly to be dreaded, and it is perfectly natural that
      it should be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as this idea is retained, which is admitted by all our
      politicians, and so energetically expressed by Mr. Louis Blanc in these
      words&mdash;"Society receives its impulse from power," so long as men
      consider themselves as capable of feeling, yet passive&mdash;incapable of
      raising themselves by their own discernment and by their own energy to any
      morality, or well-being, and while they expect everything from the law; in
      a word, while they admit that their relations with the State are the same
      as those of the flock with the shepherd, it is clear that the
      responsibility of power is immense. Fortune and misfortune, wealth and
      destitution, equality and inequality all proceed from it. It is charged
      <a name="link48" id="link48"></a> <span class="pagenum">48</span> with
      everything, it undertakes everything, it does everything; therefore it has
      to answer for everything. If we are happy, it has a right to claim our
      gratitude; but if we are miserable, it alone must bear the blame. Are not
      our persons and property in fact, at its disposal? Is not the law
      omnipotent? In creating the educational monopoly, it has undertaken to
      answer the expectations of fathers of families who have been deprived of
      liberty; and if these expectations are disappointed, whose fault is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      In regulating industry, it has undertaken to make it prosper, otherwise it
      would have been absurd to deprive it of its liberty; and if it suffers,
      whose fault is it? In pretending to adjust the balance of commerce by the
      game of tariffs, it undertakes to make commerce prosper; and if, so far
      from prospering, it is destroyed, whose fault is it? In granting its
      protection to maritime armaments in exchange for their liberty, it has
      undertaken to render them self-sufficient; if they become burdensome,
      whose fault is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, there is not a grievance in the nation for which the Government does
      not voluntarily make itself responsible. Is it any wonder that every
      failure threatens to cause a revolution? And what is the remedy proposed?
      To extend indefinitely the dominion of the law, i.e., the responsibility
      of Government. But if the Government undertakes to raise and to regulate
      wages, and is not able to do it; if it undertakes to assist all those who
      are in want, and is not able to do it; if it undertakes to provide work
      for every laborer, and is not able to do it; if it undertakes to offer to
      all who wish to borrow, easy credit, and is not able to do it; if, in
      words that we regret should have escaped the pen of Mr. de Lamartine, "the
      State considers that its mission is to enlighten, to <a name="link49"
      id="link49"></a> <span class="pagenum">49</span> develop, to enlarge, to
      strengthen, to spiritualize, and to sanctify the soul of the people"&mdash;if
      it fails in this, is it not obvious that after every disappointment,
      which, alas! is more than probable, there will be a no less inevitable
      revolution?
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall now resume the subject by remarking, that immediately after the
      economical part <a href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4"
      id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a> of the question, and before the
      political part, a leading question presents itself. It is the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      What is law? What ought it to be? What is its domain? What are its limits?
      Where, in fact, does the prerogative of the legislator stop?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no hesitation in answering, Law is common force organized to
      prevent injustice;&mdash;in short, Law is Justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not true that the legislator has absolute power over our persons and
      property, since they pre-exist, and his work is only to secure them from
      injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not true that the mission of the law is to regulate our consciences,
      our ideas, our will, our education, our sentiments, our works, our
      exchanges, our gifts, our enjoyments. Its mission is to prevent the rights
      of one from interfering with those of another, in any one of these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Law, because it has force for its necessary sanction, can only have the
      domain of force, which is justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as every individual has a right to have recourse to force only in
      cases of lawful defense, so collective force, so which is only the union
      of individual forces, cannot be rationally used for any other end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link50" id="link50"></a> <span class="pagenum">50</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The law, then, is solely the organization of individual rights that
      existed before law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Law is justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far from being able to oppress the people, or to plunder their
      property, even for a philanthropic end, its mission is to protect the
      people, and to secure to them the possession of their property.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be said, either, that it may be philanthropic, so long as it
      abstains from all oppression; for this is a contradiction. The law cannot
      avoid acting upon our persons and property; if it does not secure them,
      then it violates them if it touches them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law is justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more clear and simple, more perfectly defined and bounded,
      or more visible to every eye; for justice is a given quantity, immutable
      and unchangeable, and which admits of neither increase or diminution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depart from this point, make the law religious, fraternal, equalizing,
      industrial, literary, or artistic, and you will be lost in vagueness and
      uncertainty; you will be upon unknown ground, in a forced Utopia, or, what
      is worse, in the midst of a multitude of contending Utopias, each striving
      to gain possession of the law, and to impose it upon you; for fraternity
      and philanthropy have no fixed limits, as justice has. Where will you
      stop? Where is the law to stop? One person, Mr. de Saint Cricq, will only
      extend his philanthropy to some of the industrial classes, and will
      require the law to slight the consumers in favor of the producers.
      Another, like Mr. Considérant, will take up the cause of the working
      classes, and claim for them by means of the law, at a fixed rate,
      clothing, lodging, food, and <a name="link51" id="link51"></a> <span
      class="pagenum">51</span> everything necessary for the support of life. A
      third, Mr. Louis Blanc, will say, and with reason, that this would be an
      incomplete fraternity, and that the law ought to provide them with tools
      of labor and education. A fourth will observe that such an arrangement
      still leaves room for inequality, and that the law ought to introduce into
      the most remote hamlets luxury, literature, and the arts. This is the high
      road to communism; in other words, legislation will be&mdash;as it now is&mdash;the
      battlefield for everybody's dreams and everybody's covetousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Law is justice.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this proposition we represent to ourselves a simple, immovable
      Government. And I defy anyone to tell me whence the thought of a
      revolution, an insurrection, or a simple disturbance could arise against a
      public force confined to the repression of injustice. Under such a system,
      there would be more well-being, and this well-being would be more equally
      distributed; and as to the sufferings inseparable from humanity, no one
      would think of accusing the Government of them, for it would be as
      innocent of them as it is of the variations of the temperature. Have the
      people ever been known to rise against the court of appeals, or assail the
      justices of the peace, for the sake of claiming the rate of wages, free
      credit, tools of labor, the advantages of the tariff, or the social
      workshop? They know perfectly well that these matters are beyond the
      jurisdiction of the justices of the peace, and they would soon learn that
      they are not within the jurisdiction of the law quite as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the law were to be made upon the principle of fraternity, if it
      were to be proclaimed that from it proceed all benefits and all evils&mdash;that
      it is responsible for every individual grievance and for every social
      inequality&mdash;then <a name="link52" id="link52"></a> <span
      class="pagenum">52</span> you open the door to an endless succession of
      complaints, irritations, troubles, and revolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Law is justice</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it would be very strange if it could properly be anything else! Is not
      justice right? Are not rights equal? With what show of right can the law
      interfere to subject me to the social plans of Messrs. Mimerel, de Melun,
      Thiers, or Louis Blanc, rather than to subject these gentlemen to my
      plans? Is it to be supposed that Nature has not bestowed upon me
      sufficient imagination to invent a Utopia too? Is it for the law to make
      choice of one amongst so many fancies, and to make use of the public force
      in its service?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Law is justice</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And let it not be said, as it continually is, that the law, in this sense,
      would be atheistic, individual, and heartless, and that it would mold
      mankind in its own image. This is an absurd conclusion, quite worthy of
      the governmental infatuation which sees mankind in the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then? Does it follow that if we are free, we shall cease to act? Does
      it follow that if we do not receive an impulse from the law, we shall
      receive no impulse at all? Does it follow that if the law confines itself
      to securing to us the free exercise of our faculties, our faculties will
      be paralyzed? Does it follow, that if the law does not impose upon us
      forms of religion, modes of association, methods of education, rules for
      labor, directions for exchange, and plans for charity, we shall plunge
      headlong into atheism, isolation, ignorance, misery, and greed? Does it
      follow, that we shall no longer recognize the power and goodness of God;
      that we shall cease to associate together, to help each other, to love and
      assist our unfortunate brethren, to <a name="link53" id="link53"></a>
      <span class="pagenum">53</span> study the secrets of nature, and to aspire
      after perfection in our existence?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Law is justice</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is under the law of justice, under the reign of right, under the
      influence of liberty, security, stability, and responsibility, that every
      man will attain to the fullness of his worth, to all the dignity of his
      being, and that mankind will accomplish with order and with calmness&mdash;slowly,
      it is true, but with certainty&mdash;the progress ordained for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that my theory is correct; for whatever be the question upon
      which I am arguing, whether it be religious, philosophical, political, or
      economical; whether it affects well-being, morality, equality, right,
      justice, progress, responsibility, property, labor, exchange, capital,
      wages, taxes, population, credit, or Government; at whatever point of the
      scientific horizon I start from, I invariably come to the same thing&mdash;the
      solution of the social problem is in liberty.

      And have I not experience on my side? Cast your eye over the globe. Which
      are the happiest, the most moral, and the most peaceable nations? Those
      where the law interferes the least with private activity; where the
      Government is the least felt; where individuality has the most scope, and
      public opinion the most influence; where the machinery of the
      administration is the least important and the least complicated; where
      taxation is lightest and least unequal, popular discontent the least
      excited and the least justifiable; where the responsibility of individuals
      and classes is the most active, and where, consequently, if morals are not
      in a perfect state, at any rate they tend incessantly to correct
      themselves; where transactions, meetings, and associations are the least
      fettered; where labor, capital, and production suffer the least from
      artificial <a name="link54" id="link54"></a> <span class="pagenum">54</span>
      displacements; where mankind follows most completely its own natural
      course; where the thought of God prevails the most over the inventions of
      men; those, in short, who realize the most nearly this idea that within
      the limits of right, all should flow from the free, perfectible, and
      voluntary action of man; nothing be attempted by the law or by force,
      except the administration of universal justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot avoid coming to this conclusion&mdash;that there are too many
      great men in the world; there are too many legislators, organizers,
      institutors of society, conductors of the people, fathers of nations,
      etc., etc. Too many persons place themselves above mankind, to rule and
      patronize it; too many persons make a trade of looking after it. It will
      be answered&mdash;"You yourself are occupied upon it all this time." Very
      true. But it must be admitted that it is in another sense entirely that I
      am speaking; and if I join the reformers it is solely for the purpose of
      inducing them to relax their hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not doing as Vaucauson did with his automaton, but as a physiologist
      does with the human frame; I would study and admire it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am acting with regard to it in the spirit that animated a celebrated
      traveler. He found himself in the midst of a savage tribe. A child had
      just been born, and a crowd of soothsayers, magicians, and quacks were
      around it, armed with rings, hooks, and bandages. One said&mdash;"This
      child will never smell the perfume of a calumet, unless I stretch his
      nostrils." Another said&mdash;"He will be without the sense of hearing,
      unless I draw his ears down to his shoulders." A third said&mdash;"He will
      never see the light of the sun, unless I give his eyes an oblique
      direction." A fourth said&mdash;"He will never be upright, unless I bend
      his legs." A fifth said&mdash;"He will not be able to think, unless I
      press his <a name="link55" id="link55"></a> <span class="pagenum">55</span>
      brain." "Stop!" said the traveler. "Whatever God does, is well done; do
      not pretend to know more than He; and as He has given organs to this frail
      creature, allow those organs to develop themselves, to strengthen
      themselves by exercise, use, experience, and liberty."
    </p>
    <p>
      God has implanted in mankind also all that is necessary to enable it to
      accomplish its destinies. There is a providential social physiology, as
      well as a providential human physiology. The social organs are constituted
      so as to enable them to develop harmoniously in the grand air of liberty.
      Away, then, with quacks and organizers! Away with their rings, and their
      chains, and their hooks, and their pincers! Away with their artificial
      methods! Away with their social laboratories, their governmental whims,
      their centralization, their tariffs, their universities, their State
      religions, their inflationary or monopolizing banks, their limitations,
      their restrictions, their moralizations, and their equalization by
      taxation! And now, after having vainly inflicted upon the social body so
      many systems, let them end where they ought to have begun&mdash;reject all
      systems, and try liberty&mdash;liberty, which is an act of faith in God
      and in His work.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
